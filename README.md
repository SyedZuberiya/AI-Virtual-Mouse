# Virtual Mouse Project

The **Virtual Mouse Project** enables you to control your computer using hand gestures. It uses a webcam and a combination of **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** to detect hand movements and simulate mouse actions. With this project, you can move the cursor, click, scroll, and even control the system's volume, all through hand gestures.
